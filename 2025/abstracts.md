# Talk Abstracts

## Tutorial Talk

### Shichang Song : _Projective Fraisse limits and profinite groups_

We show that the projective Fraisse limit of the class of finite groups is the free profinite group on a countably infinite set converging to 1. Also, we prove that its automorphism group has ample generics. Joint work with Sulin Hu.

## Invited Talks

### Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda : _Some decision problems in finitely presented groups and semigroups_

I'll give an overview of some algorithmic problems in algebra, focussing on the word problem and membership problem. I'll first present some recent results in the past few years by myself and coauthors (Foniqi & Gray) on the word problem for one-relation monoids, a problem that has remained open for over a century, since 1914. Using embeddings of right-angled Artin groups and trace monoids, I will show how the first known undecidability results for one-relation monoids can be proved: the rational subset membership problem can be undecidable. Finally, I'll present some recent results by myself and Gray (East Anglia), where we fully classify which Artin groups have decidable submonoid/rational subset membership problem. This extends a result from 2007 by Lohrey & Steinberg, who classified which right-angled Artin groups have decidable membership problems.


### Seungrak Choi : _Formalizing intuitionistic negations in natural deduction system_

This talk examines how historical intuitionists have employed the concepts of negation and contradiction in two distinct senses, focusing particularly on the works of L. E. J. Brouwer, Michael Dummett, and Neil Tennant. In doing so, it reveals that within intuitionism, the notion of contradiction has also been utilized in two different ways, especially regarding the definition of negation in terms of contradiction. Building on this historical and philosophical background, the talk argues that standard intuitionistic natural deduction systems fail to capture the full spirit of intuitionism. They do not adequately formalize the intuitionistic notion of negation and thus cannot fully represent the intuitionistic stance against the principle of excluded middle—that every meaningful statement is either true or false.

More specifically, this talk contends that the classical notion of contradiction, commonly symbolized as ⊥ (falsum), is insufficient for representing the meaning of intuitionistic negations, particularly when it comes to the concept of “prooflessness.” In the standard intuitionistic natural deduction systems, the crucial difference between “a statement not being true” and “a statement being false” collapses. To remedy these shortcomings, the talk proposes an enhanced intuitionistic natural deduction system that incorporates both the classical notion of contradiction (⊥) and a new symbol (⋏), representing an intuitionistic notion of contradiction centered on the absence of proof. By integrating ⋏, this approach preserves the important distinction between statements lacking proof and those proven false, thereby ensuring a more faithful reflection of intuitionistic principles. The resulting system, which employs two kinds of contradictions and negations within a single logical framework, resonates with recent developments in paraconsistent and relevant logics, while suggesting that natural language may inherently rely on this nuanced blend of notions.

### Javier de la Nuez González 

### Dongwoo Kim : _Reference and Analysis in Frege_

I discuss Frege's definition of number. I argue that the definition is intended to preserve the references of the ordinary number terms.

### Sewon Park : _Real functions are continuous, continuously, computationally_

In this talk, I present an axiomatization and formalization of computable analysis in constructive dependent type theory. It provides an axiomatic type of real numbers where constructive proofs from mathematical analysis are extracted to certified real-number computation programs. The axioms are sound for the realizability interpretation of dependent type theory in the category of assemblies over Kleene's second algebra. To formalize interesting hyperspace computations, we further assume a general continuity principle from which we prove that all real functions are, in a sense, continuously continuous. 
This talk is based on my joint work with Michal Konečný and Holger Thies.
