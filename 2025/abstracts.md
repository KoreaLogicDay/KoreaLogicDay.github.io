## Tutorial Talk

### Shichang Song: _Projective Fraisse limits and profinite groups_:

We show that the projective Fraisse limit of the class of finite groups is the free profinite group on a countably infinite set converging to 1. Also, we prove that its automorphism group has ample generics. Joint work with Sulin Hu.
