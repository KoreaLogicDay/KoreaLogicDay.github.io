### Seungrak Choi	(University of Seoul), "_Two Reduction Procedures for Classical Reduction_"

The present talk represents the exploration of the dissimilar outcomes from Prawitz’s reduction procedure for classical reductio vis-á-vis Stålmarck-Andou’s for it. While Prawitz (1965, 1971)’s contributions, encompassing the normalization theorem, subformula property, and consistency for standard weak classical logic, are well-regarded, the normalization proof by Stålmarck(1991) and Andou(1995) for the standard full classical logic has not been widely investigated.

### Junyoung Jang (McGill University), "_Adjoint Logic: Multiple Modalities into a Computational Framework_"

_Modal logics and modal types_ have taken important positions both in philosophical logic and computational type systems and changed our understanding of the structure of truth and computation: necessity logic/type ($$\square$$), temporal logic/type ($$\mathtt{next}$$), lax logic/type ($$\bigcirc$$), and so on. One natural question arises from the variety of important modalities: is there a unifying framework explaining many different modalities? Here I present the elegant and powerful framework, _adjoint logic_, which can describe all the previously mentioned modalities. The expressive power of this framework is well-demonstrated with its applications to analysis in the context of computer science: message-passing protocol, garbage collection, strictness, and dead-code elimination, amongst others.

### Hanul Jeon (Cornell University), "_Separating the Wholeness axioms_"
 
Corazza introduced the Wholeness axiom, which asserts the existence of an elementary embedding $$j: V \to V$$. Unlike the Reinhardt embedding, the Wholeness axiom is consistent with the axiom of choice. Hamkins formulated finer versions $$\mathsf{WA}_n$$ of the Wholeness axioms and proved that  $$\mathsf{WA}_0$$  does not prove $$\mathsf{WA}_1$$, but it is open whether $$\mathsf{WA}_{n+1}$$ proves the consistency of $$\mathsf{WA}_n$$. In this talk, I will briefly sketch the proof for $$\mathsf{Con}(\mathsf{ZFC}+\mathsf{WA}_0)$$ from $$\mathsf{ZFC}+\mathsf{WA}_1$$, which gives a partial answer to Hamkins' question.

### Donghyun Kim	(Korea National University of Transportation), "_고등학교 및 대학 교양 논리학 교육 개편 방향_"

교육부의 교육과정 개편에 따라 고등학교 교양 과목인 "논리학"의 교육과정 또한 새롭게 개편되었고 그에 따른 교과서가 제작 중에 있다. 본 발표에서는 기존 교육과정과 비교하여 새로운 교육과정이 어떤 특징이 있는지를 설명하고, 현재 진행중인 교과서 집필 현황에 대해 소개한다. 아울러 고등학교 논리학 교육이 대학의 교양 논리학 교육과 어떻게 연계되고 차별화되어야 하는가에 대한 발표자의 의견을 제시한다.

### Junguk Lee (Changwon National University), "_An introduction to model companion : Infinite sets are NOT trivial!_" 

In this talk, I will introduce a notion of model companion from Model Theory, and I try to convince that infinite sets are NOT trivial in a model theoretic view through the lens of model companion.

### Eunsuk Yang	(Jeonbuk National University), "_Fuzzy extensions of Implicational tonoid logics_"

We address fuzzy extensions of implicational tonoid logics. To be more precise, we first define the class of implicational tonoid prelinear logics and show that tjose logics are complete with respect to linearly ordered matrices. We next introduce a relational semantics for finitary implicational tonoid prelinear logics and verify that those logics are complete on the semantics. Finally we generalize the term ``semilinear'' to a notion, which can be applied both in a algebraic context and in a set-theoretic context and show that those logics are semilinear in the set-theoretic context.
