### Jang Junyoung (McGill University), "_Adjoint Logic: Multiple Modalities into a Computational Framework_"

_Modal logics and modal types_ have taken important positions both in philosophical logic and computational type systems and changed our understanding of the structure of truth and computation: necessity logic/type ($$\square$$), temporal logic/type ($$\mathtt{next}$$), lax logic/type ($$\bigcirc$$), and so on. One natural question arises from the variety of important modalities: is there a unifying framework explaining many different modalities? Here I present the elegant and powerful framework, _adjoint logic_, which can describe all the previously mentioned modalities. The expressive power of this framework is well-demonstrated with its applications to analysis in the context of computer science: message-passing protocol, garbage collection, strictness, and dead-code elimination, amongst others.
